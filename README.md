# Python-Course-Projects
This repository contains my solutions to exams and a final project, all focused on Python programming. This work was completed as part of a professional development program with **VelpTEC GmbH**.

The objective of this program was to deepen my understanding and practical application of Python for tasks such as data processing, automation, and general software development.

## Repository Structure:

The coursework is organized as follows:

*   **/exams**: Contains solutions for six Python exams. Each exam is in its own subfolder with a dedicated `README.md` detailing the specific tasks and skills demonstrated.
    *   **Exam 1:** Simple Console Calculator - (Developed a console-based calculator for basic arithmetic operations with error handling.)
    *   **Exam 2:** Basic Library Management System - (Created a program to manage a library database with search, add, filter, and display functionalities via a console menu.)
    *   **Exam 3:** Name List Processor (File I/O and JSON Conversion) - (Program to read names from a text file, convert to JSON, and save to a new file, with error handling.)
    *   **Exam 4:** Customer Feedback Analysis Tool - (Analyzed customer feedback using regex for date extraction, keyword identification, and saving results to JSON files.)
    *   **Exam 5:** Tkinter Quiz Application with Timer and File I/O - (Developed a GUI quiz app with Tkinter, featuring a threaded timer and result saving/loading.)
    *   **Exam 6:** Object-Oriented Bookstore Simulation - (Simulated an online bookstore using OOP principles, with classes for Books and a Bookstore.)
*   **/project**: Houses the final Python project:
    *   **Project:** Extractive Text Summarizer - (Developed a program for extractive text summarization by tokenizing, cleaning, scoring sentences, and selecting top sentences.)

## Key Python Skills Demonstrated Across This Coursework:

*   **Python Fundamentals:** Solid understanding of Python syntax, data types, control flow (loops, conditionals), functions, and modular programming using standard library modules (e.g., `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`, `sys`, `json`).
*   **Data Structures & Collections:** Proficient in using and manipulating core Python data structures including lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries for effective data modeling.
*   **File I/O & Data Persistence:** Experienced in reading from and writing to various file formats (text, JSON), data serialization with `pickle` (if used, based on course content chapter 8.5), and robust error handling (`try-except`, `with` statements).
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Applied OOP principles by defining classes, creating objects, implementing methods (including `__init__` and `__str__`), and utilizing inheritance (as seen in Bookstore example).
*   **Text Processing & Regular Expressions:** Skilled in string manipulation, understanding Unicode, and using regular expressions (`re` module) for pattern matching and data extraction.
*   **GUI Development (Tkinter):** Developed graphical user interfaces with Tkinter, including widget management, event handling, layout design, and using threads for responsiveness.
*   **Algorithm Design & Problem Solving:** Applied Python to solve a variety of practical problems, design algorithms (e.g., text summarization), and build small projects as detailed in the course.
*   **Development Practices:** Familiar with debugging techniques, version control (Git), and writing commented, understandable code.
